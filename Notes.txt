The react-three-fiber library is a great way to create 3D scenes in React

This canvas comes from the react-three-fiber library

Canvas apni height aur width apne parent element se leta joki yaha root hai 

Mesh(mesh) is used to create the objects in 3Js like reactangle, square, cone etc.

Mesh(mesh) first use the boxGeometry to create the objects Like <mesh> <boxGeometry/> </mesh>

OrbitControls will help to rotate the box or the object

We Removed the mesh as we have to make the laptop as the object

Created an MacContainer as a Container

Will use the useGLTF this is a hooks will load the 3-D model

Primitive is a way to render 3D objects in react-three-fiber

Camera will act as a camera for the scene for us

Fov(field of view) is the field of view of the camera in degrees

Environment component from drei package is used to add a background to the scene

Meshes are the frames and these are working on the radians so we have used here "degtoRad"

meshes.screen.rotation.x = Three.MathUtils.degToRad(180); Will Rotate the screen by 180(degree) 

ScrollControls is added to add the scrollbar

let data = useScroll(); This is used to get the scroll data 

useFrame((state, delta) => {
    mashes.screen.rotation.x = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(180 - data.offset * 90);
});
Used to rotate the screen of the MacContainer

Value of the data.offset is between 0 and 1

let tex = useTexture("./red.jpg");  Used to import the image to apply on the screen of the laptop

meshes.matte.material.map = tex ->  This is used to apply the texture to the screen

This is used to adjust the colour of the frame:
meshes.matte.material.metalness = 0;
meshes.matte.material.emissiveIntensity = 0;
meshes.matte.material.roughness = 1;
